# Wiki
I've started implementing some designs from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) designs.
Wiki is a better looking wikipedia based on [Wikipedia concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/1508672-Wikipedia-concept?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=aureliensalomon&utm_content=Wikipedia%20concept&utm_medium=Social_Share) design by Aur√©lien Salomon on dribbble.

## Installation

First clone project then cd to project folder and Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install dependencies.

```bash
npm install 
```
then you can start project like other react.js projects:
```bash
npm start
```
## What I used?

![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=ReactBootstrap&message=1.3.0&color=5ed3f4)
![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Sass&message=4.14.1&color=ce679a)
I used create-react-app boilerplate to have initial project and for styling used Sass, also react bootstrap as ui-library.
